Image Classification on CIFAR-10: A Comparative Study of Optimization Algorithms

Project Overview

This project aims to investigate the performance of various optimization algorithms on a standard image classification task using the CIFAR-10 dataset. We will experiment with a shallow neural network architecture and compare the following optimization algorithms:

    
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with Warm Restarts: A simple yet effective optimization algorithm that periodically resets the learning rate to escape local minima.   
Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG): An extension of SGD that incorporates momentum to accelerate convergence.  
RMSprop: An adaptive learning rate algorithm that adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on its historical gradient.  
NAdam: A combination of RMSprop and momentum, offering efficient and robust optimization.  
Learning Rate Schedulers: Techniques to dynamically adjust the learning rate during training, including:

    Exponential Decay: Gradually reduces the learning rate over time.   
    Step Decay: Reduces the learning rate at specific intervals.  

Methodology

    Data Preparation:
        Load the CIFAR-10 dataset and preprocess it (e.g., normalization, data augmentation).
    Model Architecture:
        Design a shallow neural network architecture suitable for image classification.
    Optimization Algorithms:
        Implement or use existing implementations of the specified optimization algorithms.
    Training and Evaluation:
        Train the neural network using each optimization algorithm and record the training time.
        Evaluate the performance of the trained models on a validation set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.   

    Comparison and Analysis:
        Compare the convergence speed, final performance, and computational cost of different algorithms.
        Visualize the training and validation loss curves to gain insights into the optimization process.
        Discuss the impact of learning rate schedulers on the overall performance.

Expected Outcomes

    A comprehensive comparison of the performance of different optimization algorithms on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
    Insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.
    Recommendations for choosing the appropriate optimization algorithm for different scenarios.
    A well-documented codebase that can be used as a reference for future projects.

By conducting this experiment, we aim to contribute to the understanding of optimization techniques and their practical applications in deep learning.
